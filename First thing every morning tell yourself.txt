First thing every morning tell yourself: today I am going to meet the busy-body,
an ignorant person, a bully, a liar, a schemer, and the lazy. Ignorance of good
and evil is what makes them what they are. But I know good from evil, and I know
that these people are my brothers in the struggle to do what's right, yet
we are both endowed with the faculty to reason. None of them can harm me, for
they cannot make me do wrong against my will. I cannot be angry with them and
resent them, for we are meant to work together like the upper and lower rows
of teeth. To work against one another is contrary to nature, and in what way
could you do worse to work with them than to resent and abandon them?
