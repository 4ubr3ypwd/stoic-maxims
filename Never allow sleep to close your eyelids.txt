Never allow sleep to close your eyelids until you have examined all your actions
of the day by your reason. In what have I done wrong? What have I done? What
have I omitted that I ought to have done? If in this examination you have
done wrong, reprove yourself severely for it. And, if you have done good, rejoice!
Practice thoroughly all these things, meditate on them well, love the practice
with all your heart. It is this that will put you on the way to virtue.

Pythagoras
